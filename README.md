# distribution-fitting-yelp-data
**Scope:** Identifying the probability distributions that are well suited to describe Yelp reviews data and providing an estimation of their parameters.

Here we use Yelp dataset to study the statistics of online reviews in the metropolitan area of Arizona. In particular we want to analyse the probability distribution
that is well suited to describe the data and provide an estimate for the parameters of such distribution.  Then, we analyse the consistency of ratings and the similarity
of statistical distribution for two different states namely, Arizona and Nevada.

We conclude that a composite distribution which consists of a Gaussian Kernel for the body and power law for the tail is 
well suited to describe Yelp reviews data.
